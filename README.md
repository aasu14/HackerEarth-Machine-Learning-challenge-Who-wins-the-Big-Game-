## ABOUT CHALLENGE
The Big Game is the annual American football championship and one of the most celebrated events in the history of sports. It is not only one of the most-watched sports events across the globe, but also has the reputation of being the second-largest day in terms of food consumption in the US. Every fan eagerly waits for the Game Day to find out if their favorite team wins.

A sports betting firm has utilized the data augmentation technique to synthesize a data set of championship outcome of the Big Game's participants and other data. Your task is to generate a model to determine and classify whether a given team will win the championship or not.

# Data Set
The dataset consists of certain parameters such as average age of players on the team, level of experience of the head coach, number of players on the team that were first round draft picks, number of injured players in the team, number of wins the team has in the ongoing season, and more.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can anticipate the winning or losing chances of a given team
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of classification as it is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning
We challenge you to build a model that classifies whether a given team will win or lose on the Game Day.
